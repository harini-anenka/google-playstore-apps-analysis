# ðŸ“Š Google Play Store Apps & Revenue Analysis


##  **ðŸ”¹ Overview**

This project analyzes over 2.3M apps from the Google Play Store to uncover market trends, user behavior, and monetization strategies.
The dataset was cleaned using Power Query, and advanced calculations were performed using DAX (e.g., revenue estimation, price standardization across currencies).


## **ðŸ”¹ Key Insights**

ðŸ“Œ**Market Structure**

Over 98% of apps are free, making the ecosystem highly ad-driven.

A few categories such as Education, Tools, and Music dominate in sheer app volume.

ðŸ“Œ**Installs & Usage**

Total installs exceeded 740B, growing over 330% YoY.

However, installs are concentrated in fewer categories, with Tools and Communication apps capturing the majority.

ðŸ“Œ**Revenue & Monetization**

Estimated total revenue: â‚¹119.38B, up 76.7% YoY.

Revenue is heavily skewed toward a handful of publishers (e.g., Mojang, Square Enix).

Paid apps remain niche, with most priced under â‚¹500. Medical & Role-Playing apps are among the costliest.

Free apps dominate installs but underperform in direct revenue, depending on ads and in-app purchases.

ðŸ“Œ**User Ratings & Quality**

Despite growth in installs, average ratings have declined as app volume surged.

High installs do not guarantee better ratings, indicating that quality and engagement differ significantly by category.

Editorâ€™s Choice apps consistently show higher ratings and stronger monetization compared to others.

ðŸ“Œ**Trends Over Time**

Post-2015, app releases and updates surged, aligning with rapid smartphone adoption.

Despite frequent updates, overall user satisfaction (ratings) dipped, showing quantity > quality trend.

##  ðŸ”¹ **Tools & Techniques**

Power Query â†’ Data cleaning, handling missing values, standardizing fields.

Power BI â†’ Interactive dashboards & KPI design.

DAX â†’ Revenue calculation (Revenue = Price Ã— Installs).

Advanced measures for YoY growth and averages.

Currency normalization across different price listings.



## ðŸ”¹ **Takeaways**

Google Play is a high-volume, low-price ecosystem where free apps dominate, and only a few publishers capture most revenue.

Monetization gap: installs grow much faster than revenue, suggesting missed opportunities in paid features and IAP.

Paid apps are a premium niche, with medical/entertainment genres commanding higher prices.

Sustainability challenge: ratings dropping despite growth indicates rising competition and possibly lower app quality.

## ðŸ”¹ **Future Enhancements**
